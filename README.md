# amazonClone

An Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS is a static e-commerce website that mimics the layout and design of Amazon's homepage and product pages.
This project serves as a front-end practice exercise for web developers to improve their skills in responsive design, layout structuring, and UI/UX styling.
